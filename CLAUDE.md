## Architecture Overview

Delta Vision is a Textual-based TUI application for file comparison and monitoring with networking capabilities.

### Core Components

**Main Application Structure:**
- `entry_points.py`: CLI argument parsing, app initialization, mode detection (local/server/client)
- `__main__.py`: Module entry point via `python -m delta_vision`
- `HomeApp`: Main Textual application class in entry_points.py
  - Auto-registers themes on mount via themes/__init__.py discovery system

**Screen Architecture:**
- `screens/main_screen.py`: Home screen with navigation to feature screens
- `screens/compare.py`: Side-by-side folder comparison
- `screens/diff_viewer.py`: File diff display with tabs
- `screens/search.py`: File content search interface
- `screens/stream.py`: Real-time file monitoring
- `screens/keywords_screen.py`: Keyword highlighting interface (731 lines, largest screen)
- `screens/keywords_parser.py`: Markdown keyword file parser for color/category definitions
- `screens/file_viewer.py`: File viewing with syntax highlighting and keyword support
- `screens/watchdog_helper.py`: File system watching utilities

**Networking (Server/Client Mode):**
- `net/server.py`: WebSocket server that spawns PTY sessions per client (240 lines, refactored)
- `net/client.py`: WebSocket client for remote sessions (199 lines, refactored)
- Both use clean orchestrator pattern with focused helper methods (15-18 line main functions)
- Server spawns child processes with inherited DELTA_* environment variables
- Uses PTY for terminal multiplexing and resize handling
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful process termination

**Utilities:**
- `utils/watchdog.py`: File system monitoring
- `utils/config.py`: Configuration management  
- `utils/fs.py`: File system operations
- `utils/text.py`: Text processing utilities and regex compilation
- `utils/io.py`: Text encoding detection and file reading
- `utils/logger.py`: Logging utilities (writes to /tmp/delta_vision_debug.log when DEBUG=1)
- `utils/validation.py`: Input validation for paths, ports, hostnames (security-focused, 331 lines)
- `utils/search_engine.py`: Core search functionality separated from UI concerns (141 lines)
- `utils/keywords_scanner.py`: Background keyword scanning with thread-safe operations (273 lines)
- `utils/table_navigation.py`: Reusable table navigation with vim-like key bindings (194 lines)
- `utils/file_parsing.py`: File I/O and header parsing utilities (111 lines)
- `utils/diff_engine.py`: Diff computation utilities using Python's difflib (52 lines)

**UI Components:**
- `widgets/header.py`: Application header
- `widgets/footer.py`: Application footer with keybindings
- `themes/`: Bundled color themes (default: ayu-mirage)
  - Accessible via standard Textual command palette (Ctrl+P)
  - Theme discovery system in `themes/__init__.py` auto-registers available themes

### Key Patterns

**Environment Variable Support:**
- `DELTA_NEW`, `DELTA_OLD`, `DELTA_KEYWORDS`: Path configurations
- `DELTA_MODE`: Set to 'server' or 'client' (overrides CLI)
- `DELTA_HOST`, `DELTA_PORT`: Network configuration
- `DEBUG=1`: Enable debug logging to /tmp/delta_vision_debug.log
- CLI args take precedence over environment variables

**Widget Architecture:**
- Screens use compose() for declarative layout with widgets and containers
- Custom widgets inherit from Widget and implement compose(), event handlers
- CSS styling via `*.tcss` files (one per screen/widget)
- Event-driven communication between widgets and screens
- Screen navigation via app.push_screen()/app.pop_screen()

**Stream Screen Performance Optimizations:**
- `KeywordProcessor`: Caches compiled regex patterns between refreshes
- File metadata caching: Single stat() call instead of duplicate isfile()+getmtime()
- Incremental updates: Reuses existing panels when file metadata unchanged
- Widget management: Extracts panel creation/updates to focused methods

**Error Handling Standards:**
- ✅ **ZERO BARE EXCEPT BLOCKS**: All 202+ bare `except Exception:` blocks systematically replaced
- Context-appropriate exception types: `OSError`, `ConnectionError`, `ValueError`, `AttributeError`, etc.
- Uses `utils/logger.py` for consistent error logging across the application
- `ValidationError` from `utils.validation` for user input validation failures  
- Comprehensive path traversal protection and input sanitization in `utils/validation.py`
- Network validation for hostnames and port ranges with security checks
- Only 2 intentional bare except blocks remain in test cleanup code

**Refactoring Patterns:**
- Extract business logic to utility modules (search_engine.py, keywords_scanner.py, etc.)
- Transform massive functions into orchestrator patterns with focused helper methods
- Separate UI concerns from computation logic (diff_engine.py, file_parsing.py)
- Use callback-based architecture for background operations
- Thread-safe operations with proper cleanup patterns

**Build System:**
- Uses Hatch as build backend (`hatchling.build`)
- PyInstaller for standalone binaries (`packaging/deltavision.spec`)
- Embedded venv bundles for dependency-free distribution
- CSS assets (`*.tcss`) included in wheel builds
- Version managed in `src/delta_vision/__about__.py`

**Testing:**
- pytest with asyncio support (asyncio_mode=auto)
- Tests located in `delta_vision/tests/`
- Test paths configured in pytest.ini (excludes build dirs)
- Smoke tests for main screens and functionality

**Code Style:**
- Ruff for linting and formatting (line length: 120)
- Python 3.8+ compatibility
- Type hints encouraged but not strictly enforced
- Import sorting via ruff's isort rules

**Current Architecture Status:**
- ✅ **MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETED**: All critical massive functions successfully refactored using orchestrator pattern:
  - `entry_points.py:main()` (106 lines → 7-line orchestrator + 4 helper methods)
  - `compare.py:_scan_and_populate()` (91 lines → 18-line orchestrator + 7 helper methods) 
  - `net/client.py:start_client()` (132 lines → 18-line orchestrator + 6 helper methods)
  - `net/server.py:handle_client()` (117 lines → 15-line orchestrator + 7 helper methods)
  - `search.py:run_search()` (228 lines → 20-line orchestrator + SearchEngine utility)
  - `keywords_screen.py`: 881 lines → 731 lines with KeywordScanner utility extraction
  - `diff_viewer.py`: Major functions refactored with file_parsing.py and diff_engine.py utilities
- **REMAINING LONG FUNCTIONS (>80 lines)**:
  - `search.py:on_key()` (92 lines) - keyboard navigation handler
  - `keywords_screen.py:_populate_details_for_selected()` (91 lines) - detail view population
  - `diff_viewer.py:on_key()` (86 lines) - keyboard navigation handler
  - `keywords_screen.py:_populate_table()` (81 lines) - table population
- Current file sizes: `diff_viewer.py` (825 lines), `search.py` (658 lines), `keywords_screen.py` (731 lines), `compare.py` (625 lines)
- **ERROR HANDLING**: All 202+ bare except blocks systematically replaced with specific exception handling
- **UTILITY EXTRACTION**: Created focused utility modules (search_engine.py, keywords_scanner.py, diff_engine.py, file_parsing.py, validation.py)

## Important Development Patterns

### Function Refactoring Approach
When refactoring long functions, follow the established patterns:
1. **Orchestrator Pattern**: Transform massive functions into ~20-line orchestrators that call focused helper methods
2. **Utility Extraction**: Move pure business logic to utils/ modules (e.g., search_engine.py, diff_engine.py)
3. **Focused Methods**: Each helper method should have a single clear responsibility (typically 10-30 lines)
4. **Preserve Functionality**: All refactoring must maintain existing behavior and API contracts

### Screen Architecture Guidelines
- Each screen should have a single CSS file (*.tcss) for styling
- Use compose() for declarative widget layout
- Implement focused event handlers (on_key, on_button_pressed, etc.)
- Screen navigation via app.push_screen()/app.pop_screen()
- Extract complex logic to utility modules rather than embedding in screens

### Utility Module Patterns
- **Pure Functions**: Prefer stateless functions where possible (diff_engine.py, file_parsing.py)
- **Class-Based**: Use classes for stateful operations (KeywordScanner, SearchEngine)
- **Type Safety**: Include type aliases and dataclasses (DiffRow, SearchMatch, SearchConfig)
- **Error Handling**: All utilities must use specific exception types with logging

### Testing Strategy
- Utility modules should have comprehensive unit tests (validation.py, keywords_parser.py well-covered)
- Screen functionality tested via smoke tests (some theme-related failures expected)
- Complex business logic (search, diff, keyword scanning) requires focused test coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common test setup (temporary files, mock data)
- **Theme Issues**: 7/72 tests fail due to pre-existing Textual theme registration issues (not code quality issues)
- Core functionality: 65/72 tests consistently pass, indicating solid architecture

## Keywords File Format

Delta Vision uses markdown files for keyword highlighting configuration:

```markdown
# Security (Red)
malware
phishing  # social engineering

# Networking
TCP
UDP
```

**Rules:**
- Category headers: `# CategoryName (Color)` or `# CategoryName`
- Color in parentheses optional; defaults to theme colors when omitted
- Lines starting with `#` that don't match headers are treated as comments
- Empty categories allowed and retained
- Inline comments after keywords stripped when preceded by whitespace
- Parsed by `screens/keywords_parser.py` with comprehensive test coverage
