## üìä DETAILED CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Remove Build Artifacts (Save ~126MB)
```bash

rm -rf __pycache__/
rm -rf .pytest_cache/
rm -rf .ruff_cache/
rm -rf delta_vision/.pytest_cache/
rm -rf delta_vision/.ruff_cache/
```

### Priority 2: Clean Up Duplicates
```bash
# Remove duplicate app directory if confirmed duplicate
rm -rf build_app/

# Remove any .pyc files
find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
```

### Priority 3: Special File Cleanup
```bash
# Check for and remove the __REMOVE_ME__ file in themes
rm -f delta_vision/src/delta_vision/themes/__REMOVE_ME__
```

### Priority 4: Optional Cleanup
```bash
# Optional: Remove analysis files if not needed
# rm CODE_ANALYSIS.md
# rm RELEASE.md

# NOTE: Do NOT remove New/, Old/, or keywords.md - they are needed for testing
```

## üöÄ CLEANUP SCRIPT

Create and run this script to perform the cleanup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup.sh - Clean up Delta Vision project

echo "üßπ Starting Delta Vision cleanup..."

# IMPORTANT: Preserving New/, Old/, and keywords.md as they are needed for testing

# Remove build artifacts
echo "Removing build directories..."
rm -rf build/ dist/ build_app/ build_env/ release/

# Remove cache directories
echo "Removing cache directories..."
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -type d -name ".pytest_cache" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -type d -name ".ruff_cache" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete

# Remove special files
echo "Removing special files..."
rm -f delta_vision/src/delta_vision/themes/__REMOVE_ME__

# NOTE: NOT removing New/, Old/, or keywords.md - they are essential for testing
echo "‚úÖ Preserving test data directories (New/, Old/) and keywords.md"

# Optional: Remove virtual environment (uncomment if desired)
# rm -rf .venv/

echo "‚úÖ Cleanup complete!"
echo "Space saved: ~203MB"
echo "Test data preserved: New/, Old/, keywords.md"

# Show remaining structure
echo "üìÅ Remaining structure:"
tree -I '.git|.venv' -L 2
```

## üìù NOTES

1. **Virtual Environment**: The `.venv/` directory is already in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to the repository.

2. **Test Data**: The `New/` and `Old/` directories and `keywords.md` file are **ESSENTIAL** for testing the application. They must be preserved as they are actively used for testing compare/diff functionality.

3. **Build Scripts**: The `/scripts/` directory is essential for creating releases and should be kept.

4. **Documentation**: While `CODE_ANALYSIS.md` and `RELEASE.md` are not needed for runtime, they provide valuable documentation and could be kept.

5. **Git Cleanliness**: After cleanup, run `git status` to ensure no important files were removed. All removed directories are already in `.gitignore`.

6. **Backup Recommendation**: Before running cleanup, consider creating a backup:
   ```bash
   tar -czf delta_vision_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .
   ```

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After cleanup, verify:
- [ ] Application still runs: `python -m delta_vision`
- [ ] Tests still pass: `pytest tests/`
- [ ] Linting works: `ruff check .`
- [ ] Build scripts work: `bash scripts/make_release.sh`
- [ ] Git status is clean: `git status`
- [ ] No important files were deleted
- [ ] ~203MB of space was recovered
